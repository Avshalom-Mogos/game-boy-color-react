# Game Boy Color React Project Rules

## Always Include in Context

When working on this project, always read and reference:
- `research/components.md` - Component breakdown and specifications
- `research/plan.md` - Project plan and implementation phases

These files contain the architecture, component structure, and project roadmap that should guide all development decisions.

## Component Guidelines

Each component is placed in its own folder with a kebab-case name (lowercase with hyphens).

### Folder Structure

```
components/
├── component-name/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── style.module.css
```

### Folder Content

- **index.tsx** - Component implementation
- **style.module.css** - Component styles using CSS Modules

### Code Style

- Use arrow functions for components
- Use named exports (no default exports)
- Never destructure props
